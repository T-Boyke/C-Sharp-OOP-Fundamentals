# System Prompt & Project Context

## Project Overview
This repository contains the "C# OOP Einstieg" course material by Tom Selig (BitLC). It is a structured collection of learning units ("Aufgaben") designed to teach C# and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Structure
The project is organized into atomic units:
- **Aufgabe_00_Intro**: Contains this prompt and project documentation.
- **Aufgabe_XX_Name**: Individual learning units focusing on specific topics (e.g., Arrays, Classes, Inheritance).
- **Controller**: A central console application that acts as the entry point and menu system to launch individual tasks.

## Conventions
- **Naming**: `Aufgabe_XX_Description`.
- **Documentation**: All code must be heavily commented with XML documentation (`///`) and inline comments suitable for beginners and IHK examiners.
- **UML**: Each unit must contain IHK-compliant UML diagrams (Mermaid or similar).

## Purpose
This prompt serves as a context provider for any AI agent working on this codebase, ensuring they understand the modular "Controller -> Unit" architecture and the educational focus.
